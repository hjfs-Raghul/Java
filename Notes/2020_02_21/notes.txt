Design Patterns :
	
	pattern or method or way to design an application or system.
	solution to commonly occuring problem.

	1. SingleTon design pattern
		
		only one object for the entire application. eg.,Database connectivity object
		SingleTon class is designed and constrained in a way that it allows to create only one instance.

		1.1. Eager Intialisationed SingleTon
			
			private static final SingleTon class instance
			private constructor to avoid instialisation
			function to get the SingleTon class instance
			as soon as the SingleTon class is loaded , the instance is created.
	
		1.2. Static Block Intialisation
		
			SingleTon class instance is created inside static block.

		1.3. Lazy Intialised SingleTon
	
			Instance is created only when getInstance is called.
			There is a chance for creation of two instances in multi threaded environment.

		1.4. Thread Safe SingleTon
		
			Synchronized Lazy Intialisation	

	2. Factory Design Pattern

		Object cration logic is hidden from the user.
		Object creation is done in the seperate.
